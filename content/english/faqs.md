### Q: Why should I join this workshop?

It’s your chance to explore how money works in the real world through activities, games, and challenges designed just for students your age.


### Q: Isn’t this only useful for adults with jobs or bank accounts?

It’s designed especially for students. Even if you’re just starting to get pocket money or thinking about spending online, it’s a chance to explore how money works.

### Q: Am I too young to learn about money?

Not at all! You don’t need to be a certain age to get curious about how money works. The sooner you start, the easier it gets. Learning now helps build confidence as you grow.

### Q: Do I need to be good at maths?

Nope. If you can count, think, and make decisions, you’re all set. This is more about how money works in everyday life than doing calculations.

### Q: Is the workshop just like sitting in a regular lesson?

Nope. it’s way better than that! You’ll be doing fun, interactive activities like teaming up, solving challenges, and trying real world simulations (think managing fake bank accounts and using pretend debit/credit cards). It’s all about learning by doing, not just listening.

### Q: Do we get to make our own money choices?

Yes! You’ll make decisions about spending, saving, and managing accounts in different scenarios. You’ll see the outcomes play out during the session with no real risks.

### Q: What if I don’t have any money to manage yet?

No worries! The workshop isn’t about how much money you have. It’s about learning how it all works. Think of it like training for a game: you practice first so you’re ready when the real match starts.

### Q: What if I already know a bit about money?

That’s great! You’ll still get to try new activities, explore real life scenarios, and maybe see money from a different angle.
