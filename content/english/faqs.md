### Q: Why should I join this workshop?

Because itâ€™s your chance to explore how money works in the real world through activities, games, and challenges designed just for students your age.


### Q: Isnâ€™t this only useful for adults with jobs or bank accounts?

Itâ€™s designed especially for students. Even if youâ€™re just starting to get pocket money or thinking about spending online, itâ€™s a chance to explore how money works.

### Q: Am I too young to learn about money?

Not at all! You donâ€™t need to be a certain age to get curious about how money works. The sooner you start, the easier it gets. Learning now helps you avoid mistakes and feel confident as you grow.

### Q: Do I need to be good at maths?

Nope. If you can count, think, and make decisions, youâ€™re all set. This is more about how money works in everyday life than doing calculations.

### Q: Is the workshop just like sitting in a regular lesson?

Nope. itâ€™s way better than that! Youâ€™ll be doing fun, interactive activities like teaming up, solving challenges, and trying real world simulations (think managing fake bank accounts and using pretend debit/credit cards). Itâ€™s all about learning by doing, not just listening.

### Q: Do we get to make our own money choices?

Yes! Youâ€™ll make decisions about spending, saving, and managing accounts in different scenarios. Youâ€™ll see the outcomes play out during the session with no real risks.

### Q: What if I donâ€™t have any money to manage yet?

No worries! The workshop isnâ€™t about how much money you have. Itâ€™s about learning how it all works. Think of it like training for a game: you practice first so youâ€™re ready when the real match starts.

### Q: What if I already know a bit about money?

Thatâ€™s great! Youâ€™ll still get to try new activities, explore real life scenarios, and maybe see money from a different angle.
